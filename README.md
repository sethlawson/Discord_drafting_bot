# Discord_drafting_bot
A discord bot for multiplayer card drafting, with deck mapping functionality for Yugioh! cards

All of this bot's events occur asynchronously in response to messages. 
To use, replace token with your own, ideally pulling it from a seperate file.
Replace 2011list1.txt with your list of cards. 
Replace all instances of embed_listformatter with packlist_formatter to play with non-Yugioh cards.
